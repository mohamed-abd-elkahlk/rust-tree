# Rust-Tree

In UNIX/LINUX systems, as well as MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows, the tree is a recursive directory listing program that produces a depth-indented listing of files. With no arguments, the tree lists the files in the current directory. When directory arguments are given, the tree lists all the files or directories found in the given directories each in turn. i made a clone of it called rust-tree
